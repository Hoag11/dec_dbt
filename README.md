<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project focuses on designing a data warehouse to store and manage all successful checkout transactions efficiently. The warehouse is built on Google BigQuery, leveraging its scalability and performance for handling large volumes of transactional data.

<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
Storage: Google BigQuery (Cloud Data Warehouse)</br>
Data Transformation: dbt (Data Build Tool) for data modeling, cleaning, and transformation</br>
Data Visualization: Looker for creating dashboards and insightful reports</br>

<h3>Current Status</h3>
The project is still in development and has not yet reached its final version. Currently, we are:

1.Designing the Data Warehouse Schema: Ensuring it aligns with business requirements and supports analytical queries efficiently.</br>
2.Implementing dbt Models: Transforming raw transactional data into structured, meaningful datasets for analysis.</br>
3.Building Looker Dashboards: Visualizing key metrics and trends related to region of customer and customer behavior.</br>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>Optimizing dbt models for better query performance</ul>
<ul>Continuing collect data</ul>
<ul>Improving the Data Warehouse Schema design</ul>
<ul>Expanding the Looker dashboards with more advanced analytics</ul>
